# Heap
This is a Max Heap class I designed as a part of my Data Structures course. 

It contains the following functions
1) Insertion
2) Deletion
3) Sorting of heap
4) Building a Max Heap from a given array of elements

It follows the rule that the array in which the elements of the heap are stored, 
has the 0th element null, and starts inserting elements from position 1.
